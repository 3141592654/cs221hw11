# cs221hw11
To run, use make.
I used mostly the same parameters Eitan used; num_iter=9,000,000; pop_size=1000; mut_rate=0.3; nthreads=3 because that is how many I can allocate to my virtual machine. The runtime was 28.339 seconds (although really this is only significant to the first significant figure, as it can vary by plus or minus about three seconds). With no parallelism (I.E. the code in the hw10 solution with num_iter = 9 million instead of 2 million), it takes 57.733 seconds. With 2 threads, it takes 30.648 seconds. With 4, it takes 29.590 seconds. This is somewhat longer than with 3 cores. This is expected, as I can only allocate 3 cpus to my virtual machine. My GA does not beat the provided shortest.tsv. The shortest.tsv in this submission is the result of an nthreads=3 execution which lasted 26.181 seconds.
